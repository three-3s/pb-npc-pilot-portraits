name: Force Enemy Portrait Overlays
desc: |
  Forces overlays to be used for the enemy units etc (e.g., player-controlled green allied units). Selects a random portrait-overlay-image that is not in use by any other unit in the battle (where feasible).
  (Not covered by this mod: Adding overlay-portrait images. Use other mods for that; see 'Sample: 2D Portraits' for one example/starting point.)
