name: Force NPC Portrait Overlays
desc: >-
  Assigns pilot-portrait/overlay to every 'random' combat pilot (both enemy & allied). Specifically, selects a random portrait-overlay-image that is not in use by any other pilot. The built-in (i.e., non-portrait) overlays are excluded.

  (Not covered by this mod: Adding overlay-portrait images. Use other mods for that; see 'Sample: 2D Portraits' for one example/starting point.)
